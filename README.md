Here is a todo app I created.

There are two main features:
- Daily
- Weekly

Place tasks to do today in the daily list.  For items you need to do tomorrow, or later in the week, place them in the weekly list.
One advantage of the lists is that it can store recurring tasks for specific days, so you don't need to keep adding them to the list each week.

Each of the time periods has an add, edit, and delete function, so you can easily create and update specific lists.
